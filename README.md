# Description

This repository contains C code focused on parallel processing, and multithreading. The current implementation demonstrates a simple encoding task executed using multiple threads, showcasing the benefits of parallelism in computational efficiency.

While the primary example involves encoding, the framework is designed to be highly flexible and can be customized to execute a wide range of tasks. By modifying the task-specific functions, users can adapt the code to suit their own applications, whether those involve data processing, numerical simulations, file handling, or any other computational workload that can benefit from parallel execution.

## Features

- **Multiprogramming and Multithreading**: Utilize multiple threads to run tasks concurrently, making full use of modern multi-core processors.
- **Simple Task Example**: The repository includes a simple encoding task to demonstrate the basic setup and execution of parallel tasks.
- **Customizable**: Easily replace the encoding task with other custom tasks by modifying the task function, allowing for diverse applications.
- **Scalability**: Adjust the number of threads and the workload distribution dynamically, facilitating efficient scaling across different hardware configurations.
